# Questions of interest

Is it possible to identify the accents of a set of audio files in the English language?

# Type of problem

This is a classification problem using regression models.

# Methodology

The objective of this project is to identify the accent of a set of English audios using data classification models. Different classification techniques such as linear regression, logistic and SVM will be explored to maximize the quality of the predictions.

The data used in this study was provided by the platform [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and consists of a collection of audio speech in the English language. This collection includes audio from individuals of different age, gender and accent.

# Metrics

The performance of the models and their results in this project will be measured based on Accuracy, Recall, F1-score and Confusion Matrix.

# Data set

The dataset taken for this project can be obtained from the following resource at the kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mozillaorg/common-voice

# Exploratory data analysis
