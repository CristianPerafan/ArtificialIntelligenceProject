# **Artificial Intelligence Project**

This project is a part of the Artificial Intelligence course at Icesi University. This project is developed by:
- Juan David Garz√≥n
- Cristian Perafan
- Geovanny Quintero

# Questions of interest

Is it possible to identify the accents of a set of audio files in the English language?

# Type of problem

This is a classification problem using regression models.

# Methodology

The objective of this project is to identify the accent of a set of English audios using data classification models. Different classification techniques such as linear regression, logistic and SVM will be explored to maximize the quality of the predictions.

The data used in this study was provided by the platform [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and consists of a collection of audio speech in the English language. This collection includes audio from individuals of different age, gender and accent.

# Metrics

The performance of the models and their results in this project will be measured based on Accuracy, Recall, F1-score and Confusion Matrix.

# Data set

The dataset taken for this project can be obtained from the following resource at the kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mozillaorg/common-voice

# Exploratory data analysis

# Future steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
3. Results Analysis
4. Initial Impact Analysis
5. Deployment Plan
6. Documentation and Reporting

# Ethical aspects

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for accent detection raises significant ethical considerations. Firstly, the social and cultural impact of this technology is substantial, as it can influence how individuals are perceived and treated in various contexts such as education, employment, and social interactions, potentially reinforcing existing cultural and social stereotypes. Additionally, there is a risk that algorithms may develop biases leading to unfair discrimination against certain ethnic or cultural groups by associating specific accents with negative characteristics or stereotypes. Such bias could have detrimental effects on equity and social justice. Furthermore, the collection and analysis of voice data for accent identification raise concerns about individual privacy, underscoring the importance of informed consent and data protection in the use of this technology
